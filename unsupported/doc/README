Verilog Behavioral Simulator Documentation 1.2.0

	This directory contains the documentation for the VBS package
as of version 1.2.0.  For version 1.3.0, many of the details still
apply.  There are no changes in the documentation for version 1.3.0.
The documentation needs a complete rewrite for better organization.
Look for better documentation in version 1.3.1.  I sincerely appologize
for the lack of documentation.
